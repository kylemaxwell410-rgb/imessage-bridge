# Changelog

What changed in each release of iMessage Bridge, for the people who use it.
`scripts/release.sh` turns the Unreleased section into the new version's section
and uses it as the GitHub release notes.

## Unreleased

### Changed
- Sending now goes into the existing conversation with the recipient, so Messages picks
  iMessage, RCS or SMS itself. On macOS 26 the old way reported success to Android numbers
  without delivering anything.
- A send is reported as sent only after the Mac's message database shows the outbound
  message. The result says which service carried it; an error means nothing was delivered.
- The `service` option on send_message is now optional and only forces a service; left
  unset, the existing conversation decides.
- While an agent is paused after reading a flagged message, sends are refused with the
  reason and the time the pause ends instead of raising a confirmation dialog.

## 0.9.2 - 2026-10-31

### Changed
- The update window lists what changed in the new version, instead of showing a cramped
  GitHub page.

### Fixed
- A phone number in another country no longer passes for an allowed recipient, a contact
  or one of an agent's selected chats just because its last 10 digits match (for example
  +33 6 12 34 56 78 and +1 361-234-5678).
- Contacts saved without a country code are now read using your Mac's region, so local
  numbers like 06 12 34 56 78 in France show the contact's name.

## 0.9.1 - 2026-10-31

### Changed
- "Connect an agent" now comes right after macOS permissions on the Setup page.

## 0.9.0 - 2026-10-31

First release.

### Added
- Menu bar app and `imessage-bridge` CLI that give AI agents (Claude Code, Grok Bot and
  other MCP clients) controlled access to iMessage: read, search and send, with pairing
  you approve on the Mac.
- Per-agent permissions: read, send, ask before every send, hide verification codes and
  card numbers, network access, and access to all conversations or only selected ones.
- Recipient list: sending to anyone not on it always asks first, for every agent.
- Prompt-injection screening before an agent reads a message, in up to three layers:
  built-in patterns, Llama Prompt Guard 2 running on this Mac (a one-time download), and
  Jev (TypeSafe's model, with your API key). An agent that reads a flagged message needs
  your OK for every send for the next 30 minutes.
- "Don't ask again" in the send confirmation dialog turns off an agent's
  ask-before-every-send setting.
- Automatic updates: the app checks GitHub daily and installs new versions once the
  bridge has been idle for 10 minutes.
- Signed, notarized DMG and a Homebrew cask (`brew install --cask cmer/tap/imessage-bridge`).
